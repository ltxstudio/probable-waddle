# Typing Speed Test

## Overview

This is a Typing Speed Test application designed to help users improve their typing speed while coding. The application provides various programming language snippets for users to type and tracks their Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy. It also includes features like responsive design, dark mode, and code syntax highlighting for an enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Supports JavaScript, Python, C, Java, Go, and more.
- **Real-Time Progress**: Tracks and displays WPM (Words Per Minute) and accuracy while typing.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for better usability.
- **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Highlights code snippets based on the selected programming language.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes and provides a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Result Summary**: Displays detailed results of the typing test, including WPM and accuracy after completion.
